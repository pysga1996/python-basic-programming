# The Python print statement is often used to output variables.
# To combine both text and a variable, Python uses the '+' character:
x = "awesome"
print("Python is " + x)

# You can also use the '+' character to add a variable to another variable:
x = "Python is "
y = "awesome"
z = x + y
print(z)

# For numbers, the '+' character works as a mathematical operator:
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)

# If you try to combine a string and a number, Python will give you an error:
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x + y)
